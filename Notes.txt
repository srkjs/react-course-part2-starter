Understanding the Application Layers -
TOP |
    Components -> TodoForm, TodoList
    Custom Hooks -> useTodos, useAddTodo -> Hooks use HTTP services to fetch and update data. This has all logic to manage data in cache
    HTTP Services -> todoService -> Instances of APIClient dedicated to working with specific types of objects. For example, we have todoService for working with todos and postService for working with posts
    API CLIENT -> APIClient -> Handles sending HTTP requests to backend

Each layer in this Application has a single responsibility resulting in clean and well organized architecture
Managing, maintaining code becomes easy. We can now also reuse code.
